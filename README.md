# Golden-Age-Mod
 Golden Age is a mod for Victoria 2 that takes place between the end of the Medieval Age and the beginning of the 7 Years' War (1444-1756). The mod is not out yet and is heavily inspired by EU4 for now, something I intend to change. If you have any suggestions, please comment here to help me with the development of the mod.
